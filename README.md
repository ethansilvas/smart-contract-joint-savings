# Smart Contract Joint Savings Account - UW FinTech BootCamp Module 20 Challenge

This project is my Solidity smart contract that serves as a joint savings account between two Ethereum addresses. There is functionality to deposit, withdraw, set each account address, and validate that the correct addresses are used when calling the contract functions.
